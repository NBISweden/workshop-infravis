# workshop-infravis [![gh-actions-build-status](https://github.com/NBISweden/workshop-infravis/actions/workflows/docker.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/NBISweden/workshop-infravis/actions/workflows/docker.yml)

This repo contains the course material for NBIS workshop **Infravis Plotting with R**. The rendered view of this repo is available [here](https://nbisweden.github.io/workshop-infravis/).

This workshop was requested by the [InfraViz](https://infravis.se/) infrastructure to learn how to use R for plotting and visualisation of data. The project request can be followed under the following issue [#8131](https://projects.nbis.se/issues/8131)

## Repo organisation

The source material is located on the *main* branch (default). The rendered material is located on the *gh-pages* branch. One only needs to update source materials in *main*. Changes pushed to the *main* branch is automatically rendered to the *gh-pages* branch using github actions.

:exclamation: Every push rebuilds the whole website using a pre-built docker image.

This repo is loosely based on the quarto template [specky](https://github.com/royfrancis/specky).
